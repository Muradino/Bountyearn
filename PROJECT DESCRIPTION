BountyEarn is a decentralized, Web3 bounty platform built on the Solana blockchain. It allows sponsors to create bounties and lock rewards in escrow automatically. Contributors can submit work, and payments are securely settled once a winner is approved. For added reliability, if a sponsor fails to approve a winner within the deadline, the system automatically distributes the reward to the first submission. All interactions are powered directly through users’ wallets, with no KYC required.
