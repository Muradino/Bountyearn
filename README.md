# Bountyearn
Solana-based Web3 bounty platform that automatically locks, distributes, and settles payments for completed tasks. If the sponsor does not pick a winner, rewards are auto-assigned to the first submission.

BountyEarn is a decentralized, Web3 bounty platform built on the Solana blockchain. It allows sponsors to create bounties and lock rewards in escrow automatically. Contributors can submit work, and payments are securely settled once a winner is approved. For added reliability, if a sponsor fails to approve a winner within the deadline, the system automatically distributes the reward to the first submission. All interactions are powered directly through users’ wallets, with no KYC required.
The current version displyas basic functionalities. The connect wallet button works fine.
